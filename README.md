# Payment Gateway (CKO)
To build a payment gateway, an API based application that will allow a merchant to offer a way for their shoppers to pay for their product.
## Requirements :+1:
1. Process a payment through the payment gateway and receive either a successful or unsuccessful response.
2. Retrieve the details of a previously made payment.
## Assumptions
1. Mock Acquiring bank will either **Approve** Or **Decline** the payment
2. The MerchantId is determined based on the API-Key passed into the request
3. CVV codes could be 3 or 4 digits
4. Card Numbers should be masked (Middle 8 digits should be masked) in logging and while fetching previous payments
5. PaymentId is generated by merchant not gateway (to implement duplicate payment validation before reaching to Mock Acquiring Bank)
